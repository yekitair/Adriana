# Free but ...
---------------------------------------------------------
You can use these software free of charge but if you wish to use its ful potential such as more speed and no limitation, yuo can pay by crypto.

Right now I accept USDT and ETC (Ethereum classic.

## Sloth
Sloth is a software which walk through ethereum network and seach for balanced address.
If it meets any ethereum addess with money, it will pay you.
If you are using free software, it would be maximum 1 ether, but if you pay, it will show you more than 1 ether addresses too.
I have to repeat 3 times that the chance to find any balanced number is something less than zero point many zeroes!
Use this software only for one of these reasosn:

1. You are damn lucky

2. You want to get sure with all of your flesh that ethereum is safe

3- You are very curious

4- You are so kind who wish to spend 1 ETC to me.


## Next software will come later.
